Even thgough this is a very obvious practice, the earlier you detect the issue, the cheaper you would pay the price, a lot of engineers still make the same mistake repeatly.

Their PR is very big and has more interations, and different team co-work on reviewing the PR, and they are pushed for the timeline so rush to get the reviewers signed off, but missed some obvious error detected.

And test steps are complex, they just skip some test to expect the issue never happen on the extreme code path.  

But the truth is strictly follwing the Morph's law, something could possibly happen will finally happen.

If you want to make the product reliable, do not make assumption, follow the review and test process stictly, and cover as much as you can.  

I know doing these things manually would cost a lot, but try to automate and leverage AI assistant.
