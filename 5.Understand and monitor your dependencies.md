Most of the time we think we have done solid code reivew and enough test, it shouldn't have issue when deploy to production.

But the reality is that your services have much more dependices than you thought, the network, disks, certificates, libraries, external services calls, or even certain customer input.

Make sure you understand all these dependencies as much as possible, and build necessary test and monitor process to validate if any broken changes from these aspects.

I saw a lot of critical customer incidents come from these "unawared change".
